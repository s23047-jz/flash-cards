The LaTeX style for thesis

It was prepared on Linux Debian, so it will work on it without any additional effort. If you have different OS, try your preferred environment. In case of Overleaf, you can copy the files into the project and try to build it. It should work, but I didn't test it.

# Requirements

You need ```texlive-full``` on Debian based distributions to build this document.

Installation of dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install -y texlive-full
```

# Build

You just type make, so:

```bash
make
```

for cleaning up, you type:

```bash
make clean
```
# Contributing

You can PR with proposed changes. You should quite clearly describe what does th PR do and if it is reasonable, it will be merged, and your name will appear on the list of authors.
